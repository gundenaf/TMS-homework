# Homework No. 16 - Web Server Performance Testing

## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to conduct performance testing on your web server to assess its performance under heavy loads and various types of user activity.

## Tasks:

1. **Install and Configure Performance Testing Tools:** Begin by installing and configuring performance testing tools such as Apache JMeter or Gatling.

2. **Define Key Performance Metrics:** Identify the essential performance metrics that need to be measured. These could include response time, latency, throughput, and CPU load.

3. **Create Test Scenarios:** Develop test scenarios that simulate different types of user activities on the website. For instance, simulate page views, adding items to the cart, completing an order, etc.

4. **Set Test Parameters:** Specify parameters for the test scenarios, including the number of users, requests per unit of time, test duration, and more.

5. **Run Tests and Monitor in Real-Time:** Execute the tests and monitor the server's performance in real-time. Collect data on response times, latency, throughput, and CPU load at varying levels of load.

6. **Analyze Test Results:** Analyze the test results to understand how the server performs under different loads. Determine the maximum load the server can handle and identify any bottlenecks or weaknesses in the infrastructure.
