# Homework No. 21 - Setting Up Ansible Environment

## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to configure the Ansible environment on your local machine, enabling you to use it for automating configuration management and deployment of applications on remote servers.

## Task 1: Configuring Ansible Environment

Follow these steps to set up your Ansible environment:

Install Ansible on your local machine. Installation instructions can vary depending on your operating system. Refer to the official installation guide for Ansible at https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/index.html to find detailed installation steps.

Create an inventory file that contains information about the servers you plan to manage using Ansible. The inventory file can be in either INI or YAML format.

Create an Ansible configuration file to define global Ansible settings. The configuration file can be located in various places, including directories like /etc/ansible and ~/.ansible/.

Create a simple Ansible playbook to perform a basic task on one of your servers. For instance, you can create a playbook that installs packages on a server.
