## Goal: Applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts in Python

Practice applying learned concepts: OOP, classes, and OOP in Python.

## Tasks:

1. Create a class named "Circle" with attributes "radius" and "color," and methods to calculate the area and circumference. Create multiple objects of this class and call its methods for each object.
2. Create a class named "BankAccount" with attributes "account number," "owner's name," "balance," and methods to deposit and withdraw money. Create multiple objects of this class and call its methods for each object.
3. Create a class named "Student" with attributes "name," "age," and "average grade." Create methods to calculate the average grade and determine the student's status (excellent, good, average). Create multiple objects of this class and call its methods for each object.
4. Create a class named "Book" with attributes "title," "author," and "publication year." Create methods to get and modify these attributes. Create multiple objects of this class and call its methods for each object.
5. Create a class named "Car" with attributes "make," "model," "color," and "year of manufacture." Create methods to get and modify these attributes. Create multiple objects of this class and call its methods for each object.

## Steps:

1. Familiarize yourself with the tasks and determine what is required. Read the tasks multiple times to fully understand them.
2. Create a Python file to write code for completing the tasks.
3. Write a class that corresponds to each task. Define the class attributes, its methods, and any other details required to complete the task.
4. Create multiple instances of the class and call its methods for each instance. Ensure that all methods work correctly and produce the expected results.
5. Test your code to ensure it functions correctly. Use different input data to verify that your code works correctly in various scenarios.
6. If the tasks require output results, make sure the results are displayed correctly.
