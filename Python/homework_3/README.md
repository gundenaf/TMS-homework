## Goal: Apply the studied topics in practice: functions, working with files and directories, and using the Jinja templating engine.

The goal of this assignment is to reinforce and practice fundamental concepts and data manipulation methods in Python, such as working with strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, as well as using loops and conditional statements.

## Tasks:

1. Write a function multiply_numbers() that takes two arguments and returns their product. Then, call this function and display the result on the screen.
2. Create a file named test.txt and write the string "This is a test file for programming homework" into it. Then, open this file in read mode, read its content, and display it on the screen.
3. Create an empty directory named mydir in the current working directory. Then, navigate to this directory and create three empty files within it: file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt. Finally, display the list of files in the directory on the screen.
4. Create a template named template.html that contains HTML code for displaying a list of users. The template should use a for loop to iterate through the list elements and display the name and email of each user. Then, create a list of users as a list of dictionaries, pass it to the template, and display the result on the screen.

## Steps:

1. Study the theoretical materials on functions, working with files and directories, as well as the Jinja templating engine.
2. Create a new project and open it in your chosen development environment.
3. Create files for each task and start writing the code for them.
4. Test each function/task separately and ensure their correctness.
5. Combine all tasks into a single file or project and test their functionality together.
