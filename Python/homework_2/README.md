## Goal: Reinforce and Practice Fundamental Concepts and Data Manipulation Methods in Python

The goal of this assignment is to reinforce and practice fundamental concepts and data manipulation methods in Python, such as working with strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries, as well as using loops and conditional statements.

## Tasks:

1. Write a script that takes a list of IP addresses as input and checks their availability using ping requests. The results of the check are saved to a separate file.
2. Write a script that takes a string as input and displays the count of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and punctuation characters on the screen.
3. Write a script that takes two lists as input and displays the elements that are present in both lists.
4. Write a script that takes an array of numbers as input and sorts it in descending order.
5. Write a script that takes a tuple as input and checks if all its elements are unique.
6. Write a script that takes a list of files as input and finds files whose names contain a specific substring.
7. Write a script that takes two strings as input and displays all characters that appear in both strings.
8. Write a script that takes a list of numbers as input and finds the median of that list.
9. Write a script that takes a string as input and replaces all vowel letters with the character "-".
10. Write a script that takes two lists as input, finds common elements, and then creates a new list containing only unique elements.

## Steps:

1. Review the tasks and choose one or more that you would like to complete.
2. Create a new project in your IDE or open a file for solving the task in an existing project.
3. Write code that solves the chosen task.
4. Test your code using sample data or input provided in the task.
5. If you encounter issues while writing your code, use online resources such as Python documentation or developer communities to find appropriate solutions.
6. Once you have completed your task solution, test your code with different input data.
7. If your code works correctly, save it in a file and submit your solution to your instructor or include it in your portfolio.
