- Configure the username and email for the current repository.
- Verify that the `.git/config` file has been updated accordingly.

### 3. Create a Private Repository
- Create a private repository named `tms-git` on GitHub.
- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Download and extract files from the following link:
  [Download Files](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&confirm=no_antivirus&id=1B_b5mg7rRSKSNqwuDb1hGVYQQpHsEc1J).

### 4. Make the First Commit

- Stage the changes and commit.

## Task 2

### 1. Cloning Repository and Exploring Structure
1.1. Execute `git clone https://github.com/smartiqaorg/geometric_lib` to clone the repository.
1.2. Explore the commit history to understand the structure of commits.

### 2. Working with the `feature` Branch
- Revert the unsuccessful commit in the `feature` branch.

### 3. Working with the `develop` Branch
- Merge two similar commits in the `develop` branch and add an explanation.

### 4. Experiments: Working with `calculate.py` and `rectangle.py` in the `experiments` Branch
4.1. Create a new branch named `experiment` to conduct experimental commits.
4.2. Copy up-to-date documentation from `docs/README.md` of the latest `develop` branch commit.
4.3. Stage and commit the updated `calculate.py` from the latest `develop` commit.
4.4. Stage and commit all necessary files.
4.5. Remove `circle.py` and `square.py`, then commit.
