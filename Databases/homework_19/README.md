# Homework No. 19 - Building a Fault-Tolerant PostgreSQL Solution

## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to learn how to implement a fault-tolerant solution for databases using PostgreSQL as an example. The tasks involve setting up servers, configuring replication, ensuring high availability, and testing the fault-tolerant solution.

## Task 1:

1. Create two servers and install PostgreSQL on them. Connect both servers to the same network.
2. Configure replication between the servers to ensure that changes made on one server are automatically replicated to the other.
3. Set up high availability using replication and automatic failover mechanisms.
4. Test the fault-tolerant solution by simulating a failure on one server and verifying that the second server continues to function, and all data remains intact.
