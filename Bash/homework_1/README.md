# Bash Scripting and Automation

The goal of this homework is to learn how to perform automation tasks using Bash scripting.

## Tasks:

### Task 1: Create Student Directory

1. In the console, create a subdirectory in your home directory named `/last_name_student`, where all student's work files will be stored.

### Task 2: Write and Execute a Program

1. Use a text editor (e.g., vim: `vim 1.c`) to write a program named `1.c` that prints the phrase "HELLO Ubuntu."
2. Compile the program using the GCC compiler: `gcc 1.c -o 1.exe`.
3. Run the compiled executable: `./1.exe`.

### Task 3: Command Line Arguments Script

Write a script that displays all command-line arguments to the console and saves them to a file.

### Task 4: File Search Script

Write a script that outputs the names of all files with a specified extension (third command-line argument) from a given directory (second command-line argument) to a file (file name provided as the first command-line argument).

### Optional Tasks:

#### Task 1: Loop Through Directories

Write a script using a `for` loop that displays the sizes and permissions of all files in a specified directory (provided as the first command-line argument) and its subdirectories.

#### Task 2: Search String in Files

Write a script that searches for a user-specified string in all files within a specified directory (provided as the first command-line argument) and its subdirectories (second command-line argument). The script should display the full path and names of files containing the specified string, along with their sizes. If access is denied to any directory, a corresponding message should be displayed, and the script should continue execution.

> Note: To execute these scripts, save them with the `.sh` extension and make them executable using the `chmod +x script_name.sh` command. Run them using `./script_name.sh`.
