# Terraform Lab - Docker Container Management

## Introduction

This folder contains Terraform configuration files and a step-by-step guide for managing Docker containers using Terraform. The lab demonstrates how to import an existing Docker container and configure it with Terraform, integrating it into your infrastructure-as-code workflow.

## Lab Overview

In this lab, we will import a running Docker container, set up Terraform, and apply the configuration to manage the Docker container. The primary objective is to understand how to include pre-existing resources, like Docker containers, into Terraform management.
